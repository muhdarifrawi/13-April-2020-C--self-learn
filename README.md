# C# Self-learn 13th April 2020

## Preface
This porject was created so that I could learn and understanf C# on my own. I Googled on C# basics for Visual Studio Code and found this [website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code). So I just followed that small tutorial but I am still confused as to what and how C# is written. 

## Objectives
- [x] learn how to setup the environment
- [ ] learn the syntax
- [ ] create a simple webpage (since I studied full-stack dev)
