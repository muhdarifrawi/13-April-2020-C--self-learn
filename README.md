# C# Self-learn 13th April 2020

## Preface
This project was created so that I could learn and understand C# using Visual Studio Code (VSC) on my own. I Googled on C# basics for VSC and found this [website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code). So I just followed that small tutorial but I am still confused as to what and how C# is written. 

## Objectives
- [x] learn how to setup the environment
- [ ] learn the syntax
- [ ] create a simple webpage (since I studied full-stack dev)

### 13 April Notes :
What I have learned and understood so far was how to create the environment. You can follow through the detailed steps from the link previously mentioned. Or you could just briefly read through this.

#### Setting up the environment

Pre-requisites for setting up: 
- Installed [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Installed [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Insalled [C# Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) on Visual Studio Code (VSC)

To setup the environment:
1. Open and create a new folder in VSC. 

    The usual way I do is through CMD terminal (not Powershell). But you can just open up VSC, create new project then create new folder.

    If you want to try using my way: 
    - Press "Windows key" + "r"
    - Type in "cmd prompt"
    - Press "Ctrl" + "Shift" + "Enter" (to enable Admin)
    - Allow admin control
    - key in "mkdir _name-of-project_" into the terminal and press "Enter" (creates _name-of-project_ folder)
    - key in "cd _name-of-project_" and press "Enter" (makes you enter the _name-of-project_ folder)
    - Key in "code ." and press "Enter" (take note of the dot)

2. Create the C# environment.

    Open up the terminal in VSC (look for the Terminal tab at the top of the screen) and enter the following:
    ```
    dotnet new console
    ```

    This would build up a simple boiler plate code for you. It has the "Hello World" demo written inside. 

3. Resolve build assets.

    Key in the following into the terminal: 
    ```
    dotnet restore
    ```

    For my case, I realised that it had automatically run it for me when I ran the previous ```dotnet new console``` command.

4. Try running the pre-built code.

    Key in the following into the terminal:
    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    If all goes well, your terminal will show "Hello World."

#### notes on creating classes

Another thing I learned was that ```namespace``` is also known as your folder name. In the demo, they named thiers "HELLOWORLD"  so when the console was created, it gave the namespace "HelloWorld".

I named mine as a complicated "c#-self-learn" and it gave me a weird namespace "c__self_learn".

I blindly followed the tutorial and keyed in ```namespace HelloWorld``` and when I ran I had an error. It took me quite awhile to look for the error.
